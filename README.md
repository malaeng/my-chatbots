# my-chatbots
collection of different chatbots I've made.

### overview of different chatbots:
**chatbotv1** - basic 'chatbot' where the only thing you can do is play one of 4 games. Runs in terminal

**chatbotv2** - implemented GUI using tkinter. Only 3 games in this version

**chatbotv3** - more advanced chatbot, uisng the chatterbot library to implement Natural language processing. Trained using yml files from data folder

**chatbotv4** - chatbotv3 but with GUI, again with tkinter

**chatbotv5** - a combination of all previous chatbots - 3 games, NLP, and GUI

To run on your machine, you may need to install some python libraries
